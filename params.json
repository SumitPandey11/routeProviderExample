  "body": "### Welcome Sumit Page.\r\nIf you want to navigate to different pages in your application, but you also want the application to be a SPA (Single Page Application), with no page reloading, you can use the ngRoute module. The ngRoute module routes your application to different pages without reloading the entire application.\r\n\r\nTo make your applications ready for routing, you must include the AngularJS Route module:\r\n<script src=\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.4.8/angular-route.js\"> </script>\r\n\r\nThen you must add the ngRoute as a dependency in the application module\r\n\r\n**angular.module(\"myApp\", [\"ngRoute\"]);**\r\n\r\nNow your application has access to the route module, which provides the **$routeProvider**. Use the **$routeProvider** to configure different routes in your application:\r\n> \r\n_app.config(function($routeProvider) {_\r\n  _$routeProvider_\r\n  _.when(\"/\", {_\r\n\t_templateUrl : \"main.html\"_\r\n  _})_\r\n  _.when(\"/red\", {_\r\n\t_templateUrl : \"red.html\"_\r\n  _});_\r\n_});_\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/sumitpandey11) and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
